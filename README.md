 Dua after Wudu
 I witness that there are no partners for Allah; He alone is deserving of worship and I witness that Muhammad(ﷺ) is God’s servant and Messenger, Oh Allah! Please include myself among the penitent, and make me among those who purify themselves.

 Dua e Istikhara
 “O Allah, without a doubt, I seek goodness from you through Your knowledge, and strength through Your power. I ask for Your immense grace, for indeed You have power, and I am powerless. You have knowledge, and I know not, and You are the Knower of the unseen. O Allah, if You know that indeed this matter is better for me with regards to my faith, my livelihood, and my ultimate fate, then decree it for me, facilitate it for me, and bestow blessings upon it. And if You know that indeed this matter is not good for me in terms of my faith, my livelihood, and my ultimate fate, then distance it from me, and distance me from it. And decree goodness for me wherever it may be, and make me content with it.”
